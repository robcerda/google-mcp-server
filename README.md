# Google MCP Server

> Connect Claude to your Google Workspace with intelligent contact resolution and secure OAuth2 authentication

Transform Claude into your Google productivity assistant. Send emails to "John Smith" instead of john.smith@company.com, share files by name, and create calendar events with automatic attendee resolution.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üß† Smart Contact Resolution**: `send email to Spencer Varney about the meeting` ‚Üí automatically finds spencer.varney@company.com
- **üîí Secure by Default**: Uses [restricted scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) compatible with [Google Advanced Protection](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)
- **üì± 50+ Tools**: Complete Gmail, Drive, Calendar integration with shared drive support
- **‚ö° Safety First**: All send/share operations require explicit confirmation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/robcerda/google-mcp-server
cd google-mcp-server
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure Google
1. [Create a Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com) and enable APIs (Drive, Gmail, Calendar, People)
2. Create OAuth2 credentials (Desktop application type)  
3. Copy your credentials to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop
Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-services": {
      "command": "/path/to/google-mcp-server/.venv/bin/mcp",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/google-mcp-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üí° Examples

**Smart Email** (resolves contacts automatically):
```
Send an email to Spencer Varney about tomorrow's meeting
```

**Safe File Sharing** (shows preview, requires confirmation):
```
Share the Q4 report with the marketing team as editors
```

**Calendar with Attendees** (resolves multiple contacts):
```
Create a meeting tomorrow 2-3pm with Spencer, John, and Sarah
```

## üîê Security & Scopes

This server uses **intentionally restrictive OAuth scopes** for maximum security by default. These scopes are compatible with [Google Advanced Protection Program](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/) and follow the principle of least privilege.

### Default Scopes (Security-First)
- `drive.file` - Only files created by this app (not full Drive access)
- `gmail.send` + `gmail.readonly` + `gmail.labels` - Send, read, and manage labels
- `contacts.readonly` - Read contacts for smart name resolution  
- `calendar` - Full calendar access (Google doesn't offer restricted calendar scopes)

### Expanding Permissions
If you need broader access, add scopes to your `.env` file:

```env
# Example: Full Drive access + Gmail modify
GOOGLE_ADDITIONAL_SCOPES=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify

# Common broader scopes:
# https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive - Full Google Drive access
# https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify - Full Gmail modification
# https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets - Google Sheets access
# https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts - Full contacts read/write
```

**Security Note**: The default restricted scopes protect your account even if credentials are compromised. Only expand permissions if you specifically need the additional functionality.

**File**: Scopes are defined in `src/google_mcp_server/auth.py` (`DEFAULT_SCOPES`)

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

All potentially dangerous operations use a **two-step confirmation process**:

1. **Prepare**: `prepare_send_email()` ‚Üí Shows preview, resolves contacts
2. **Confirm**: `confirm_send_email()` ‚Üí Actually sends after your approval

No emails, file shares, or calendar invites are sent without explicit confirmation.
